# Nerdle Solver

A small program for finding all valid guesses for [Nerdle](https://nerdlegame.com/). Uses `9*8-7=65` and `0+12/3=4` as suggestions for the first and second guesses. After the second guess, it starts generating possible guesses from the information gained from the first two guesses.
